# Article Word Count
- Inside the file ["input/article.txt"](input/article.txt) is a article that we would like to know the number of times each word has been shown.

## Your Tasks
- Read the file

- Perform a count on each words inside the article

- Print the count of the words in the article

## Notes
- This isn't a grammar test. You may ignore abbreviations, hyphenations and most other punctuation. For example, "stove-lids" should be count as two different words "stove" and lids; "Samuel L. Jackson" shold be treated as three different words "Samuel", "L" and "Jackson"; "S.O.S." should be counted as two "S" and one "O"

- The only punctuation that you do need to be concerned about it the single quote ('). For example, "can't" should stay as the word "can't" and not "can" and "t"

- The test should be case insensitive. "JObs", "jobs" and "joBS" should be treated as same word and the total count should be three
