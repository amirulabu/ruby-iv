# Palindrome

- A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.

- Inside the file ["input/words.txt"](input/words.txt) is a list of words that we would like to test whether each word is a palindrome.

## Your Tasks

### Write codes to:

- Read the file *(I'm not asking you to read the file literally)*

- Separate the output to 2 groups: "palindrome" and "not_palindrome"

- Output the result on console

## Notes

- You should ignore all the differences between capital letters and non-capital letters.

- You should ignore all punctuations.

- Example, "Was it a cat I saw?" is considered as a palindrome.
