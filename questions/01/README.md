# Palindrome
- A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.

- Inside the file ["input/words.txt"](input/words.txt) is a list of words that we would like to test whether each of the words is palindrome.

## Your Tasks
- Read the file

- Separate the output to 2 groups: "palindrome" and "not_palindrome"

- Output the result on console

## Notes
- You should ignore all the differences between capital letters and non-capital letters.

- You should ignore all the punctuations.

- Example, "Was it a cat I saw?" is considered as a palindrome.
